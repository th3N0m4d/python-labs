def guessing_game():
    """
    A number guessing game where the player has 7 attempts to guess a randomly generated number.
    
    The function prompts the user to enter lower and upper bounds for the random number,
    then generates a random number within that range. The player then has up to 7 attempts
    to guess the correct number. The game ends when the player guesses correctly.
    
    Args:
        None
        
    Returns:
        None
        
    Note:
        The current implementation only handles correct guesses and may run indefinitely
        if the player doesn't guess correctly within 7 attempts.
